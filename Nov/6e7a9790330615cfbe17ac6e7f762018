Apart from entertainment, the festival aims to introduce aspirant artists to the world of music, as they are given an opportunity to perform and showcase their talent.In the past years, aspirant artists have&nbsp;been complaining that they were not considered when a line-up of artists was made. This year things will be different, since artists will be given a platform to compete at districts level, and the best artists will&nbsp;be invited to perform at the much-anticipated Mapungubwe arts and culture festival.The festival is an arts and culture event that is held to showcase the artistic expertise of Limpopo, and Moloi said artists from Limpopo would make up 80% of the line-up of both the gospel and jazz festival that will take place during the Mapungubwe Arts Festival.She encouraged the public to attend the event and to come and enjoy the beauty of Limpopo. &ldquo;Events like this festival positively contribute towards improving the economic growth of the region through tourism and job creation.&rdquo;The MEC said the artists were handpicked from all five districts of Limpopo and included well-known acts such as Colbert Mukwevho and others artists from Limpopo., &ldquo;We will conclude the festival with a massive jazz and heritage concert with internationally acclaimed stars,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;The Mapungubwe Arts Festival will open with a carnival parade in Polokwane on 1 December and will finish on the 17th. All the events will take place at venues in Polokwane.&nbsp;
