Well-known former police spokesperson in Louis Trichardt&nbsp;Capt Maano Sadike&nbsp;has added his name to the list of published South African authors with the release of his book: Reflection of the Promised.Currently attached to the police&rsquo;s provincial corporate communications office in Polokwane, Sadike is a true son of the Soutpansberg. In his book, he reflects mostly on the current situation. &ldquo;If you are interested in reading and knowing more about your country, this book is for you,&rdquo; said Sadike.Sadike studied journalism and was a well-known freelance journalist doing sports commentary on&nbsp;several sporting codes in the past. Being a journalist at heart, Sadike said, was what made him interested in the country&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;Moreover, I studied history at school, especially South African and European history. I think of the French Revolution in 1789, Napoleon Bonaparte in Corsica, Jan van Riebeeck&rsquo;s arrival in the Cape in 1652, the Dutch East Indian Company (DEIC) and Bartholomew Diaz &ndash; this history inspired me,&rdquo; said Sadike.Sadike said that although one cannot downplay the above-mentioned part of history, people need to move on and come up with something that reflects the current strengths and weaknesses of the new South Africa since 1994. &ldquo;I think it is important. Going through the book, it gives glimpses of who we are as South Africans, where we come from and where we are going,&rdquo; said Sadike.Sadike added that readers must remember that any occurrence in the book is a reflection. &ldquo;Hence when you read the book, you will develop an understanding about our country,&rdquo; Sadike said.Reflection of the Promised is available at R150 per copy.
