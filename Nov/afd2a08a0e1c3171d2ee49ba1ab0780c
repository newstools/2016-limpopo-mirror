The relationship between Black Leopards and their sharpshooter, Roggert Nyundu, came to an abrupt end&nbsp;on Monday this week. This was revealed by the club&rsquo;s chairman, Mr David Thidiela.According to Thidiela, Nyundu contravened the club&rsquo;s code of conduct for the players by taking his problems with the&nbsp;team&rsquo;s former coach, Mr Jairos Tapera, to the media. In terms of the code of conduct for the players, if a player is feeling aggrieved, for whatever reason, he is not allowed to take the matter to the media but should use internal processes to highlight his problems.Thidiela said that Nyundu accused Tapera of not fielding in an interview. In the interview, Ndundu allegedly said that the coach disliked him. Thidiela stated that Nyundu continued to criticize the coach, despite the fact that the latter had tried to explain to him that he was not doing well at training. Thidiela further indicated that the club was forced to summon the 28-year-old striker to appear before the club&rsquo;s disciplinary committee two weeks ago.Nyundu was found guilty as charged and he was served with a dismissal sanction on Monday morning. Thidiela said that the sanction will send a clear message to the other players that Black Leopards does not have a room for&nbsp;ill-disciplined players.He again said that Nyundu had&nbsp;at no stage accepted that his performance was deteriorating with time since he had joined the club two years before. &ldquo;He scored only seven goals the whole of last season, and yet he claims to be a top striker,&rdquo; said Thidiela.Thidiela also confirmed that they had given him a transfer letter together with the dismissal letter, so that he could join a club of his own choice.* Numerous attempts to reach Nyundu for comment failed, as his phone was always on voice mail and he did not return our calls.&nbsp;
