Madridtas FC fought hard to grab&nbsp;full points at the expense of Polokwane Academy when they beat them 1-0 in their ABC Motsepe League match at the Tshifudi Stadium on Saturday.Madridtas meant business from the onset, initiating some dangerous moves from the middle of the park time after time. They knocked on the opposition&#39;s door for the first time six minutes into the game. Their skillful striker, Dakalo &quot;Akonkwo&quot;&nbsp;Nemakonde, received a neat pass from Solomon Noko at the edge of the box and caused an upset by losing possession before he could unleash.That was a wake-up call to the visitors. They missed a fortune in the 18th minute when their overlapping defender, Thokozani Masuku, tried his luck from the 25-meter area with a half volley. Masuku suffered the pain of watching the ball missing the target by inches.Polokwane regrouped from behind, pushing hard in their search for an early goal, but it was difficult for them to find their way through the defence of Madridtas, which was marshalled by Maduvha Mudologi, Solomon Noko and Lutendo Mulaudzi.The goal that separated the boys from the men came in the 34th minute. Pfunzo Tshikotshi beat the offside trap and caught the keeper off guard with a half volley. Madridtas came close to scoring a second goal three minutes before the half-time whistle. Pfunzo Tshikotshi unleashed a powerful volley from just outside the penalty box. The ball went a little wide, much to the fans&rsquo; disappointment.Madridtas are now in the second position on the log, following the victory.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
