In their ABC Motsepe League match at the Tshifulanani Stadium on Saturday, Madridtas FC proved all their critics wrong by rising to the occasion and beating Joe Maweja 2-1 to remain in hot contention for the league title.Although Maweja were the first to find the net in the opening minutes of the game, the visitors from Tshifudi did not throw in the towel. They continued to fight collectively, with their midfielders dishing out some defence-splitting passes from the middle of the park. The diminutive referee, Mr Karabo Mokau, flashed the first yellow card in the 11th minute. The striker of Madridtas, Dakalo Nemakonde, was lucky to go away with a mere yellow card after handling the ball intentionally.Maweja&rsquo;s solitary came in the 24th minute. Aluwani Mbedzi hooked in the ball, following a square pass from Khumbudzo Muvhango. A defender of Maweja, Khongotela Mahlaule, was also reprimanded with a card. He obstructed Dakalo Nemakonde towards the end of the first half.Maweja used all their substitution chances in the last half. They replaced Murendeni Makonde, Thabelo Ntshauba and Elias Ranyaoa with Thanzi Muruge, Takalani Ramagalela and Sheriff Mudalahothe respectively. They committed suicide by starting to defend their lead instead of continuing to take the game to the visitors.Madridtas found the equalizer in the 59th minute. A substitute, Khathutshelo Mukomafhedzi, gave the ball the&nbsp;final touch, following a heart-breaking scramble within the box. Rofhiwa Netshiungani scored the winning goal in the 78th minute. He caught the keeper off guard and sent in a ground cutter from the 25-metre area.Maweja took the game to their opponents in the last 10 minutes, but it was already too late for them.
