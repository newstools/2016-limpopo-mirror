&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MusicAn entrepreneur, Mulalo Masikwa, has&nbsp;revived her first love of deejaying and she has&nbsp;instantly become very popular.Known by her stage name, DJ Caths, this young lady&nbsp;carved a niche for herself in the music industry as a club and popular music deejay, starting from way back in 2009. &ldquo;I have been doing a lot of projects&nbsp;that have nothing to do with me as an artist, but now I have decided to get back to what I love most, deejaying,&rdquo; she said.Her duties as a deejay include the mixing of deep house, commercial house and hip hop. She&nbsp;honed her skills&nbsp;at some community radio stations around the province before earning herself much respect from the public.She stated that being a female deejay came with challenges of its own because most people still don not&nbsp;believe that local females can be good deejays. &ldquo;But then I just want to believe that it has to do with the fact that there are more male deejays than female ones who are always active here in Vhembe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So, being a lady deejay is a bit challenging because most people don&#39;t take you seriously.&rdquo;DJ Caths recently received an invitation to perform in Zimbabwe on 9 December. She hopes to leave a musical mark in Zimbabwe, so that other South African singers and artists can form strong exchange links with artists in Zimbabwe and other African countries.She said that, during her first days, she had to work hard and prove that she could fit into&nbsp;the male-dominated world of deejaying. &ldquo;Any young woman who wants to see herself as a deejay must be passionate about the field, just like a duck taking to water,&rdquo; she said.She said she was ever grateful for the support she continued&nbsp;to get from family and friends. &ldquo;I get my mixes to be played on national, community and commercial radio stations,&rdquo; she said.For more information on DJ Caths&#39;s gigs, follow her Facebook page: Caths Mulalo Innocent Masikwa.
