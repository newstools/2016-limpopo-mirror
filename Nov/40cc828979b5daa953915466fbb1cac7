Hundreds of policemen within the Thohoyandou SAPS cluster received spiritual empowerment on the eve of the hectic festive season, when a prayer service was held for them.The annual prayer service, dubbed the Festive Season Prayer Day, was held at the SAPS Sibasa Mess Hall on Tuesday.The police members in their uniforms, the head of the cluster, Gen Azwihangwisi Mulaudzi, station commissioners from the different stations, police management, and many clerics from around Thohoyandou sang and danced before they were prayed for. Mulaudzi said the function was part of the fruits of their partnership with pastors under the Adopt a Station and Cop that started some years ago.&ldquo;We felt as police that, as the year draws to an end and we approach the festive season, we should come together and revive our members and give them more fire to be able to&nbsp;fight crime during the festive season. This time of the year is a very congested with challenges and crime being planned from many quarters.&rdquo;She added that the police were well trained in all respects, but crime still persisted&nbsp;and that was what prompted them to organise the event. &ldquo;They need spiritual upliftment,&rdquo; Mulaudzi added.She emphasised that the crimes are caused &ldquo;by demons and we are here to pray that people change their hearts and turn to God and this area will be a safer one for all.&rdquo;Mulaudzi said they would be all out in the field preventing crime in the whole cluster. &ldquo;The prayers and visits by the pastors have motivated and empowered us a lot and out of this we can promise our communities that, through our partnership with them, criminals will not have any space, come the festive season,&rdquo; she said.
