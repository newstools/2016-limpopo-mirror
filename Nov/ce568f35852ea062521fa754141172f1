The album consists of&nbsp;six tracks that have&nbsp;already become anthems for the&nbsp;festive season.&ldquo;We started planning this project some years ago, and we were only waiting for the right time, so that we could strike the right chord,&rdquo; said Denga &ldquo;Rita Dee&rdquo; Nephawe, Rita Dee Entertainment&#39;s manager and chief director.She indicated that Vhaphandi was recorded in August this year and that it was only released a fortnight ago. She said that she was happy about the collaboration. &ldquo;The project has borne the expected fruits,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We continue to receive phone calls and messages of support via social media from people who have bought and listened to Vhaphandi.&rdquo;The title of the album, Vhaphandi, can be directly translated as&nbsp;&ldquo;Hustlers&rdquo;. The other tracks on the album are Mmawe, Vhumatshelo, Ni do nkhumbula naa, Ndi kale and Ni ntakuse. &ldquo;All the tracks generally affirm a&nbsp;positive life,&rdquo; Rita Dee said. &ldquo;Vhumatshelo, or Future, is an important song&nbsp;that questions all youths about their future; youths need to study in preparation for a better future.&rdquo;Makhadzi expressed her happiness about the reception of the collaborative album by the public. &ldquo;I am excited about this project and I am also moved by the kind of response from our fans,&rdquo; Makhadzi said. &ldquo;I think every artist needs a good foundation to try different genres and deliver good music.&rdquo;She further stated that it was always good and encouraging to see that people out there loved their music. &ldquo;We work hard at creating quality music and it really comes as a bonus to us when we&nbsp;hear people playing our music everywhere,&rdquo; she said.Bhamba and Prifix stressed the point that education was the right key to open all doors for the youth of today. &ldquo;Ni songo zwifheliwa, pfunzo ndi ya ndeme (Let no one lie to you; education is important),&rdquo; said Bhamba, who holds an honours degree in hydrology and a master&#39;s degree in environmental and water sciences.Vhaphandi is available from good music stores nationwide.
