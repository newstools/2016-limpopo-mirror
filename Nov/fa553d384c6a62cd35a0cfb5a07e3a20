Here I am today, bagging awards which I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever achieve. This gives me more courage. I think this is a sign that I am doing a good job. I sing what is relevant to people&rsquo;s lives, something that empowers them,&rdquo; she said.Mazwale made a name for herself when she recorded her first music with 5 dot 5 studio. What followed is phenomenal success that steered her to where she is today. In 2014, she assembled a studio in Gauteng. &nbsp;&ldquo;I try to work with different producers to avoid creating the sounds and same level of quality every time.&quot; She added that this was the criticism that some local in-house artists received.&nbsp;She felt, however, that her talent was not being recognized. &quot;I have been wandering around and saw many things in life, but there was one thing that I was missing in life, and that was God. Everything has changed and my life has to bear testimony that I have changed. That is where this album came into being,&quot; Mazwale said.She encourages young people to realize the importance of education and to put their education first.
