&ldquo;The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. I will not be able to rule my people wisely if I don&rsquo;t get my instructions from God. He is the only One who will be able to guide me to take wise decisions that will benefit my community. That is why I have decided to get baptised next week. No one will stand between me and my God as I&rsquo;m now a changed man of God.&rdquo;These were the words of Thovhele William Mutele when he welcomed the mayor of Musina, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope, at Ha-Mutele royal palace&nbsp;outside Masisi last week. Muhlope was accompanied by the portfolio head of local economic development and technical services in Musina Municipality, Cllr Jeremiah Khunwana.The visit forms part of the mayor&rsquo;s mission to interact with traditional leaders who have been included into the new demarcation boundaries of Musina.Mutele said it was an honour for him to have been visited by the delegation from the municipality. &ldquo;This is a clear indication that the municipality takes traditional leadership very seriously. Our tradition also dictates that no one can bring development in our land without introducing themselves to the traditional leaders. This is the beginning of a good working relationship which will benefit both the municipality and our traditional council.&rdquo;Muhlope said the visit had&nbsp;paved the&nbsp;way to create a platform for the municipality to engage traditional leaders on issues related to service delivery. &ldquo;Traditional leaders are one of our main stakeholders because a huge [portion of] land in our municipality belongs to them. It is important to take them on board, so that we can have a common understanding on community development initiatives. The fact that we have allocated them seats on our council is a clear indication that we are ready to work with them.&rdquo;
