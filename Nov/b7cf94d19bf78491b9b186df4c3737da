Pupils of Mutiti Primary School were spoiled during their school&rsquo;s recent birthday celebration.The Nzhelele based school celebrated their 33th birthday on Friday, 4 November.As part of the celebrations pupils received award certificates for excellence in culture, sport and academic activities. &nbsp;All the speakers during the day encouraged the youth to work hard for their exams, distance themselves from drug abuse and crime so that they can become successful adults. The principal, Mr Avhashoni Maugana, said the rewards were meant to encourage pupils to work hard to improve education in the school. &ldquo;We have seen positive results since we started the idea of the award ceremony some years ago. The award creates a spirit of hard work and this helps in the improvement of results in our schools,&rdquo; said Maugana.He urged community members to continue supporting the school, which relays even on donations as they are situated in a very remote area.&quot;Teachers and pupils cannot make it on their own. We also need assistance from the outside world, because joint efforts will bring good results to the education of our children,&quot; said Maugana.
