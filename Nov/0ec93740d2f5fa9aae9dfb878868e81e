Local farmers in the rural areas, particularly those who have just started farming, had to travel to distant places to buy their fertilizers, seeds, crop protection chemicals, livestock remedies, animal feeds, and equipment.Thanks to a recent new initiative by Lachos Agro Dealers, these farmers will be able to get the assistance they need. The company, in association with the Limpopo Department of Agriculture and support from different structures, has embarked on an agricultural initiative to support the development of rural farming.&ldquo;Previously people would travel to far-away places for supplies which also cost them money, time and production yield,&rdquo; said Mr Luambo Munzhedzi, project coordinator at Agro Dealer Development.The company has established nearly 100 Agro dealers&rsquo; shops across the Vhembe District to assist rural farmers. &ldquo;With continuous development of Agro dealers initiatives, at least 500 - 1000 Agro dealers are needed to help our rural farmers not only to get inputs by at least 10km radius but getting more technical knowledge on farming the right way in their farms,&rdquo; said Munzhedzi.The director of Agricultural Economic Support Services for the Limpopo Department of Agriculture, Mr Tshilidzi Mathobo, added to this message.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are predominantly rural and our province largely depends on agriculture, most agricultural trades also happen in rural areas as well. So we are glad that there are agro dealers who have opened agro shops to help with advice and quality products,&rdquo; said Mathobo.The rural agro dealers continue to get support from the African Fertilizer and Agribusiness Partnership (AFAP). AFAP works through partnerships to promote the use and access to fertilizers and build the capacity of agro dealers to better serve farmers&nbsp;in Africa.The African Fertilizer Volunteers Program&#39;s project manager at AFAP, Ms Sandra Pires, said that AFAP was looking to developing more farmers and agro dealers in Limpopo.&ldquo;Limpopo province has been affected by drought and AFAP is working with the farmers to ensure farmers have access to knowledge on using improved inputs including fertilizer as a coping mechanism,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Challenges related to limited extension services for smallholder farmers.&rdquo;Those interested in the activities of agro dealers can contact Munzhedzi at 071&nbsp;273 3309 or lahcos@webmail.co.za .
