It remains to be seen whether Black Leopards will make a comeback and collect the maximum points against Mbombela United&nbsp;when they meet in their NFD match at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow afternoon.Leopards must win the match, no matter the cost, for two reasons. In the first place Lidoda Duvha must win the match in order to restore their lost pride. Winning the match will also keep their title hopes alive. Leopards lost their last two matches. They suffered an embarrassing 2-3 defeat at the hands of Stellenbosch FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium three weeks ago. They went further to donate the league points to Witbank Spurs (1-2) at the Puma Rugby Stadium in Emalahleni a fortnight ago.It will be the second match for the Leopards&rsquo; caretaker coach, Mr Sello Chokoe, to guide the Thohoyandou outfit, following the departure of the former head coach, Mr Jairos Tapera, three weeks ago. Leopards&rsquo; defenders, Jean Munganga and Marks Munyai, are expected to keep their danger area clean, while the midfielders, Ben Musaka, Ndamulelo Mungadi and Morgan Shivambu, will keep the fire burning in the middle of the park.The NFD rookies, Magezi FC, will visit the University of Pretoria, and the Cape Town derby between Milano United and Santos will be staged at the Athlone Stadium.
