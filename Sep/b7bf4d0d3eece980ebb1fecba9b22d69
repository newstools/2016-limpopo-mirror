&ldquo;I was visiting relatives in Matangari village when my phone suddenly rang. As I&rsquo;m unemployed, I thought I was going to receive good news, because I keep on applying for jobs on a daily basis. Alas, the call was from my neighbour who told me that my house was on fire. I quickly ran home and it was a painful sight&nbsp;to watch helplessly as all my efforts for many years were eaten by the angry fire. I&rsquo;m now devastated, disappointed and very sad. I thank God because there was no one in the house when the mysterious fire broke.&rdquo;This is the sad story of Edzisani Nemukongwe of Makonde-Tshithuthuni village, whose seven-room&nbsp;house was burnt to ashes last week.A father of two who survives by doing piece jobs, Nemukongwe said he had saved a lot of money over&nbsp;the past 10 years to build the house. &ldquo;Although the house took 10 years to build, I was a proud father who knew that his family had&nbsp;a place to call&nbsp;home. Now that the house has been reduced to ashes in broad daylight, I have nothing to show but only thank God that all my family members are alive.&rdquo;Nemukongwe said the cause of the mysterious fire was still unknown so far. &quot;Three beds, three wardrobes, two fridges, a laptop computer, three cell phones, a printer, all our clothes, food, blankets, identity documents and certificates have been destroyed. Although firefighters tried to stop the fire, it did not help because it was too strong and had spread to all the rooms.&quot;He added that they were only left with the clothes they were wearing and &quot;we don&rsquo;t know where our next meal will come from. We are now sleeping with relatives and from now on, we don&rsquo;t know what our next step will be,&quot; he added.According to him, they estimate the damage in the region&nbsp; of about R100 000, which is a lot of money for someone who is unemployed. &quot;We urge community members to assist us by donating anything from food, clothing and&nbsp;building material to&nbsp;furniture and household utensils.&rdquo;Nemukongwe&rsquo;s wife, Virginia, who is also unemployed, said that watching their belongings burn&nbsp;to ashes was very painful. &quot;My husband does not have a stable job, but he does everything possible to keep the family together. We are really saddened by the incident, but life should go on.&rdquo;Community members who would like to help the family can call Ms Edzisani Nemukongwe at 076 329 8105.
