Word spread like wildfire on social media, the streets and on radio shows that people of Magangeni village and some surrounding areas were consuming a home-made wine known as Xikwembu ni teki.Xikwembu ni teki could be loosely translated as &ldquo;Oh God take me!&rdquo; This blend of what is alleged to be&nbsp;illicit wine is said to be deadly in that one who drinks it is pleading with God to literally kill them.Those who spoke about it on social media, inside&nbsp;taxis and buses said that one has to consume only half a glass and then they would be totally drunk. &ldquo;People who drink Xikwembu ni teki laugh alone and mess their pants,&rdquo; said one resident. &ldquo;They feel hot and strip naked in full view of all people, including children.&rdquo;The headman of Xihlobyeni section of Magangeni village, Mr Oupa Mahungu, condemned the use of Xikwembu ni teki and said that it was just causing unhealthy disorder among his people. &ldquo;Residents complained to me about their men and sons who drink an unhealthy wine called Xikwembu ni teki,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some women even complained that it made their men weak and useless in the bedroom. They also lose appetite for all kinds of food.&rdquo;He explained that just a month ago a man who was addicted to Xikwembu ni teki died and the family heard people saying that he had died as a result of witchcraft. &ldquo;The family announced during his funeral that he was killed by Xikwembu ni teki and that nobody bewitched him to death,&rdquo; Mahungu said. &ldquo;The local Sanco members, who claim to be educated persons, support the brewing and selling of Xikwembu ni teki.&rdquo;Another resident, Mr Shadrack Ngobeni, said that he had stopped brewing Xikwembu ni teki after he learned it was an illegal wine. &ldquo;I learned the skills of brewing Xikwembu ni teki from an old man who brewed it for personal use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I turned my newly acquired skills into a small business, where I brewed and sold Xikwembu ni teki from my home. But soon people said I would be arrested and prosecuted, so I stopped.&rdquo;However, Ms Maria Maluleke is a sad mother and grandmother of nine dependants. She has been selling Xikwembu ni teki for over 15 years. She says only jealous individuals are complaining about her wine. &ldquo;Those people do not even drink Xikwembu ni teki,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nobody has ever complained about my wine before.&rdquo;There were many people sitting in small groups, consuming Xikwembu ni teki, at Maluleke&rsquo;s yard on Monday. &ldquo;People are lying in the name of Xikwembu ni teki out there, saying men who drink it can no longer make their women have children,&rdquo; one of the men, Clever Maswanganyi, said. &ldquo;My wife gave birth to our fourth child three days ago. Now what is it that people are saying about our fine wine?&rdquo;Another man, Mr Malan Ringani (64), said he started drinking Xikwembu ni teki in 1970. &ldquo;So far I have 11 children and I am stronger than ever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am still strong even today and I mean what I am saying. As you can see here for yourself, our faces are full of smiles, which only shows that we love&nbsp;Xikwembu ni teki.&rdquo;Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Waterval police, Const Cynthia Ndou, said that the police knew nothing about the alcohol known as Xikwembu ni teki. &ldquo;We are in no position to comment on this matter since we know nothing about it,&rdquo; Ndou said. &ldquo;Xikwembu ni teki &ndash; that name is new to our ears.&rdquo;
