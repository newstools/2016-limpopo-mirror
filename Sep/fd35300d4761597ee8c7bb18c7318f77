Gumbani village near Malamulele, under the auspices of the Mukhomi Territorial Council, will be benefiting from a water project by the Vhembe District Municipality.&ldquo;We stayed here from the year 2000 without water. We used to cross the main road to fetch water on the other side of the village and it was very risky because were always afraid of speeding vehicles,&rdquo; said Mrs Rirhandzu Mabsas, one of the residents.Mr Wilky Maswanganyi,&nbsp;community liaison officer of the project, indicated that the project has currently employed 10 workers and expressed the hope that more workers would still be employed. He further indicated that they had also&nbsp;requested the district municipality to&nbsp;install house-to-house water connections in the future.&ldquo;We again remind our community to use water sparingly when this project is complete, because we are in the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;drought. Our dams and our boreholes are drying up. We have allocated only R600 000 &nbsp;to the project, due to financial challenges. We request all community members in the entire district to work together to preserve water,&quot;&nbsp; the district mayor, Cllr Florence Radzilani said.&ldquo;The project will take three weeks to complete. We are laying street pipelines, so that community members are able to get water closer to the residential area and we have agreed with the community to use labour-intensive methods, so that community members are able to be employed,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;said Mr John Ndlovu of Somandla Contractors.&nbsp;
