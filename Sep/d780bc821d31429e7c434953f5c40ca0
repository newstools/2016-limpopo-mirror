Music Well-known local artist Maduvha Madima will stage the Night of Bliss with Maduvha festival at Christ Worship House Shayandima on 15 October. Community members around Vhembe will have the privilege to experience the talent of one of the giants of music performing at their doorstep. This event will play host to a unique melting pot of cultures, coming together for an enormous celebration. With an expected turnout of 7 000 to 10 000 people, this music festival is expected to bring the best local artists to cater for every market. Local legends Irene Mawela, Oliver Mtukudzi, Tshepo Tshola and Maduvha will be among the superstars invited for the event. Madima said that the festival had gained momentum in terms of participation and results, despite not being taken seriously by some groups within the media sector. “We see the event as contributing to social cohesion and nation building, while entrenching our African identity through musical performances,” she said. “Our main aim is not to make a profit from this festival, but to market our province and show our talent.” According to Madima, the festival further aims to expose the untapped talent so abundant in the communities served by the organisers as well as talent from neighbouring SADC countries. "The festival will provide the province with an opportunity to unify its citizens and its neighbouring countries to celebrate the rich cultural heritage and to promote tourism in the province, elevating the level of growing excitement amongst young adults, emerging business individuals, students and tourist enthusiasts." The entrance fee will be R150 per person and a VIP ticket will cost R400. Tickets are available at Computicket.
