Ms Petronella Mhandu of Musina Nancefield is an 81-year-old granny&nbsp;who stays with her child and two grandchildren. She has never owned a house, but the granny was overwhelmed with joy after the mayor of Musina, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope, and her delegation visited her in her new house a fortnight ago.&nbsp;The house is part of the 1 000 units allocated to the urban area of Musina by the Department of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (Coghsta). Mhandu falls in the special category that includes the disabled, senior citizens, child-headed families and foster-care recipients. The other categories of the beneficiaries still have&nbsp;to be finalized and the allocation will follow soon after all the units have been completed. Needy community members were encouraged to register their names with the municipality in June this year. &nbsp;Upon seeing the mayor and her entourage arriving, Mhandu was so happy that she started singing a thanksgiving song and the whole entourage followed suit&nbsp;and danced&nbsp;with her. &ldquo;Life has changed since the new government came in 1994. I used to rent rooms in the township and never thought that one day I will have a place called home. I really thank the mayor for having a special category to be considered to have roofs over their heads. Having a home is a dignity and with my advanced age, it was my wish that I should own a home one day. Even if I die now, I will die a happy person,&rdquo; she said.Muhlope said that there was nothing more fulfilling than when a government put&nbsp;a smile on an ordinary citizen&#39;s&nbsp;face. &ldquo;Although we have done a lot to bring a better life for all, there is still more to be done and we will continue to work hard to restore the dignity of our people.&rdquo;
