The portfolio head responsible for local economic development and technical services at&nbsp;Musina Municipality, Cllr Jeremiah Khunwana, said that service delivery issues raised by the communities of Ward 12 would be given priority as per the integrated development&nbsp;plan of the municipality.Khunwana was addressing hundreds of community members during a mayoral imbizo at the Masisi taxi rank last Friday. He&nbsp;said it was important for the municipality to intensify its outreach programmes since some changes &nbsp;had been made&nbsp;in the municipal boundaries two months ago. &ldquo;This area was part of the disestablished Mutale Municipality before the recent local government elections. Local people should live with the reality that they now fall under Musina Municipality and we should all contribute to the development of our municipality under the new demarcated boundaries. Before the local government elections, Musina had 6 wards and 12 councillors. The fact that we now have 12 wards and 24 councillors is an indication that our municipality is growing rapidly.&rdquo;Khunwana said that, according to Statistics SA, Musina had 33 061 citizens in 1996. &ldquo;In 2001, the number rose to 39 310. The 2011 figures show&nbsp;that our population grew to 68 359. The population is at present estimated at about 100 000.&quot; He added that it was&nbsp;the only municipality in Vhembe District that had recorded more than&nbsp;5% growth in recent years. &quot;This is a clear indication that we are charged with more responsibilities to serve more people to their satisfaction.&rdquo;He pleaded for cooperation from traditional leaders, community structures and local community members. &ldquo;We urge you to attend government and municipal meetings, so that you can be involved in the service delivery decisions that affect you.&rdquo;
