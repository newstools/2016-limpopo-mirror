The U/12 team of Benny&rsquo;s Sports Academy and Development returned to South Africa last week, after a successful 2016 Danone Nations Cup World Final in France. They finished in 14th&nbsp;place, with 32 countries competing in the event.&nbsp;It was South Africa&rsquo;s best finish since 2009, when they won the tournament. In the tournament, the local team beat South Korea 1-0, Italy 3-1, Uruguay 2-1 and drew 1-1 with Russia. They lost 0-1 to Indonesia, Brazil and Tunisia and later drew 1-1 with Senegal in a friendly game.On their return to South Africa, Coach Mbishi Mokwena said that the game against Brazil was their toughest.&nbsp; &ldquo;The event was a learning experience and the way the Brazilians used the field was an eye opener and very interesting to watch.&nbsp; We were lucky to lose by such a narrow margin and our goalkeeper, Hulisani Mashau, had a cracker of a game,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We went back to the drawing board after that game and used Brazil&rsquo;s tactics against Uruguay and it worked in our favour.&rdquo;It was the game against Italy that took the youngsters by surprise.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was the first all-girl team that has ever played at the world finals,&rdquo; said Mbishi.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had been warned that the girls were going to be taller and stronger than us, which was the case. They were from the academy of the famous Italian Club, AS Roma. I have to admit there were a couple of girls that were exceptionally skilled on the ball.&nbsp;They showed us a few amazing shibobo&rsquo;s (styles) that left our boys flat-footed,&rdquo; said the coach. &nbsp;For youngster Chrisjones Davhana, being in France was an enlightening experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Paris is such an exciting city, full of life and interesting sights to see.&nbsp;I loved it so much; I would like to go and live there one day.&quot;&nbsp;According to him, the food was interesting. &ldquo;I think the French eat too many vegetables and I missed my pap.&nbsp; But they have the best fish!&rdquo;
