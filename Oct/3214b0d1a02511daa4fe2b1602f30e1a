Khubvi Peace Makers gave Makonde Young Tigers no peace when they beat them 6-4 in their opening match of the Benjies Soccer Challenge at the Khubvi grounds on Sunday. The game was equally contested from the onset to the bitter end, with both sides creating and wasting scoring chances. Thihanedzwi Mbedzi, the Tigers’ overlapping defender, was a thorn in the flesh of the opposition midfielders. Mbedzi was everywhere, initiating some dangerous moves from behind while at the same time playing as a midfielder-cum-striker. Realizing that Mbedzi was giving them a headache, Peace Makers tried to neutralize him with dangerous tackles. Mbedzi was temporarily taken off the field to receive some medical attention after he was tackled from behind. Young Tigers were the first to find the net. Their centre forward, Oriel Mulovhedzi, forced his way through the defence of Peace Makers and showed the keeper the wrong way. Peace Makers lost cohesion in the middle of the park shortly after conceding the goal. They regrouped from behind towards the end of the first half, but it was difficult for them to break the Tigers’ wall. Peace Makers came back strongly in the last half and found the equalizer in the 64th minute. Zwivhuya Sikhwari tried his luck from the 35-meter area with a half volley. The keeper of Tigers, Thistime Chauke, watched helplessly as the back hit the back of the net. Peace Makers were reduced to 10 men five minutes after scoring the equalizer. Vhonani Mafukasaga was given his marching orders, following a late tackle on Khuthadzo Munyai. The score was 1-1 when the referee blew the final whistle and the winner was determined through penalty shoot-out. Peace Makers converted all five their chances while Tigers missed two.
