Three brothers from Zimbabwe died in a terrible manner when the truck they were busy loading with sand overturned and buried them at Muegedzi River at Zamenkomste last Friday. Members of the Kutama Royal Council previously warned residents of the area to refrain from mining sand in the open areas near the river, because it will result in major land corrosion during rainy seasons. The villagers and miners have been mining sand for years. The river has since run dry and there is no sand that they can mine from it. The miners thus started mining sand in the open areas in the grazing fields. The royal council also warned that these activities are illegal and people will be prosecuted. The three brothers were apparently busy loading sand onto trucks at the Muegedzi river when the accident happened. The truck overturned and trapped them beneath. They died on the spot. The police identified the deceased as Setelane, Kutakwane and Tapiwa Mahohoma, aged 19, 21 and 23 years. An inquest docket was subsequently opened. Khosikhulu Vho-Toni Mphephu Ramabulana expressed his shock about the accident and sent his condolences to the bereaved families. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased during this time of grief,” he said.
