For almost 12 years, the Maniini-Hammbi village outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo had&nbsp;been functioning without a traditional leader and it was a worrying factor for communities as they did not know whom to report to and how to solve their problems.Last Friday, things changed for the better, following the installation of Chief Ndamulelo Mmbi. Representatives of the local office of the Department of CoGHSTA, Thovhele Ratshibvumo II Rambuda, representatives of both the Vhembe and Thulamela municipalities and Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli, one of the senior traditional leaders in the Vhembe region, attended the event.The tshikona dance, which is danced when a Vhavenda Chief is installed or during his burial, was also performed as one of the highlights of the event. During the installation, Mr&nbsp; Shonani Mmbi was announced as Ndumi, while Ms Rolindela Mmbi is the Khadzi.Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli urged the new&nbsp;chief to respect and serve the communities with all his abilities&nbsp;and to do his best to bring development to the area. &ldquo;You are a chief&nbsp;because of the people. You will be serving above them and it was vitally important to treat and serve them with dignity,&rdquo; said Mphaphuli.&ldquo;We also urge for a good working relationship between the traditional leader, councillors and the Thulamela Municipality, so that the delivery of services to the communities is the priority. We understand&nbsp;there were some differences in the Mmbi&nbsp;clan and arguing about who should be installed. Let us forget and forgive each other and start working as one big family,&rdquo; he added.However, Mphaphuli warned the Mmbi&nbsp;clan to refrain&nbsp;from using the courts as a way of solving traditional-leader disputes. Another traditional leader, Chief Nkhodeni Mmbi, said the communities must know their leader as they witness his&nbsp;being installed by the senior traditional leader. &nbsp; &nbsp;
