Who is behind the escape&nbsp;of prisoners? This is the most frequently asked question whenever there is an escape from lawful police custody.The recent escape of two trial-awaiting prisoners at Tshamutumbu outside Musina is no exception and has raised many questions as to how suspects in lawful custody manage to smuggle in equipment that they use to escape. Nyaweleni Randima (25) of Khubvi and Lufuno Mudzanani (27) of Tshitavha outside Thohoyandou managed to escape after allegedly cutting the&nbsp;bars of the holding cell with a hacksaw. The two are facing kidnapping, robbery and assault charges.Rumours doing the rounds are that corrupt police officials at work might have assisted the criminals. Following the incident at Tshamutumbu, the police within the Thohoyandou Cluster have launched an extensive manhunt for the two men. Thohoyandou Cluster spokesperson&nbsp;Lt Col Mashudu Malelo said the escape happened at 17:15 on Saturday.Randima is light in complexion with dreadlocks and of medium build. He was last seen wearing white Adidas running shoes, blue jeans and a T-shirt. Mudzanani is light in complexion, stout with short hair. He was last seen wearing jeans and a long-sleeved grey jersey.Limpopo police spokesperson Col Ronel Otto said several escape&nbsp;incidents had&nbsp;occurred this year. &ldquo;We are investigating the circumstances around these escapes and our investigations will reveal if some of our members are involved in these escapes. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate is handling most of these cases,&rdquo; she added.Those with information about the fugitives can phone the Tshamutumbu SAPS, their nearest police station or detective commander&nbsp;W/O Phophi at 082 414 1621.
