The Makwarela Stadium will be the centre of attention tomorrow for the provincial semifinals and final of the Nedbank Cup for teams affiliated to the Limpopo Stream of the ABC Motsepe League. The first match will be between Great North FC and Bellevue Winners Park and will start at 09:00. The two teams have a history of giving each other a tough time each time they meet and tomorrow’s encounter is expected to be no exception. When asked about their level of readiness for the match, the chairman for Winners Park, Mr Robert Mokhola, said that his charges were ready to absorb any kind of heat. He said that they were leaving no stone unturned in their preparations for their outing against Great North. The captain of Great North, Lucas Kekana, stated that Winners Park would have to sweat in order to see their dream of taking part in the final become a reality. The second semifinal will be between Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Lephalale Young Killers. It will start at 11:00. TTM are in the right frame of mind, after holding Gawula Classic to a goalless draw in their league match at the Lulekani Stadium in Phalaborwa last Sunday. According to the coach of TTM, Mr Lucky “Mchichwa” Nelukau, his squad is injury-free and ready to represent Vhembe District well in the competition. Some of the TTM players who are sharpened to kill include Tsepo Makgoga and Mulisa Luvhengo. The winners in the semifinal matches will meet in the final later in the afternoon.
