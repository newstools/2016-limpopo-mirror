Music Community members are ready for the Night of bliss with Maduvha festival that will take place at Christ Worship House in Shayandima tomorrow. Artits Irene Mawela, Oliver Mtukudzi, Tshepo Tshola, Maduvha and a surprise artist will be among the superstars invited for the event. Mawela urges young girls to focus on getting themselves educated, as no modern man should marry an uneducated woman. “Girls must make education their first priority in life,” she said, adding that in a modern world an uneducated girl is “like an empty drum behind the door in a dry, rainless season – that drum is useless, because it has no water inside it.” She also mentioned that the kind of music she performs encourages, understands and promote respect within the family and in relationships. “Music is a gift I've been given by God to deliver positive messages to the people. I respect my art, I don't take my gift of being a singer for granted.” She added that her music is all about life-related issues such as HIV/Aids, teenage pregnancies and family matters. “Most of my messages are directed at the youth,” she said. The organiser, Maduvha Madima, said that the traditional leaders were serious about restoring culture and indigenous knowledge and commended the organisers for the initiative of reviving culture through a music festival. “As South Africans, we are celebrating the fact that someone stood up and took that action to celebrate creativity, enthusiasm, commitment and the sheer hard work of our music industry practitioners. Not only is the event an opportunity for us to celebrate our African creativity and identity, but it is good to make the contribution, the spirit that drivers nation building,” said Madima. The entrance fee will be R150 per person and VIP tickets will cost R400. Tickets are available at Computicket.
