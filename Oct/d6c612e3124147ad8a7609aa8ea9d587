After donating league points to University of Pretoria at the Thohoyandou Stadium two weeks ago, Black Leopards rectified their mistakes and beat FC Cape Town 3-2 at the same venue last Saturday.Lidoda Duvha could have scored at least five goals in the first half, but their strikers, Thembisani Nevhulamba, Ivan Mahangwahaya and Mwape Musonda, were unlucky. The home side threatened to score in the fifth&nbsp;minute when Ivan Mahangwahaya forced his way through the defence of Cape Town and lost possession within the box. Nevhulamba could not believe his eyes moments thereafter. He received a neat pass from Sphelele Mkhulise and shot aimlessly from close range.Black Leopards took the lead in the 19th minute when Lebohang Mabotja tried his luck from the far left corner. The ball went past three defenders before hitting the back of the net. The visitors lost shape in the middle of the park soon afterwards. Leopards capitalized and increased the margin through&nbsp; Nevhulamba in the 27th minute.The visitors pulled one back before the teams adjourned for half time. Andile Khumalo headed home after a corner kick on the stroke of half time. Black Leopards replaced their keeper, Lutho Mbajwa, with Aubrey Mathibe earlier in the last half. Leopards continued to create and squander scoring chances as the struggle continued.Leopards later replaced Mwape Musond and Ndamulelo Mungadi with Khayelihle Shozi and Mumuni Abubakar respectively. They increased the margin via Sphelele Mkhulise in the 74th minute. Cape Town did not give up although time was fast running out for them. They reduced the margin via Tsepo Dladla six minutes before the final whistle was blown.
