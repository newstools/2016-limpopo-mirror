A woman who thought she was smart enough to smuggle dagga to her boyfriend, who was appearing in court, ended up being arrested by the police. Tshilisanani Ramutsheli (22) of Makwarela in Sibasa was visiting her boyfriend a fortnight ago. The man is facing charges of murder and rape in the Dzanani Magistrate's Court. At the entrance of the court, Ramutsheli was stopped by the police and when they searched her bags, they found a quantity of dagga. She was arrested on the spot and appeared in court the following day. Tshilisanani Ramutsheli (22) pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months' direct imprisonment, without the option of a fine. The arresting officer, Const Olga Omphulusa Tshukalaha, who is also the Mphephu police's spokesperson, said it was around 10:15, while they were doing routine checks on people entering the court premises at Dzanani, that the woman arrived with a bag. "We were doing our work, searching all those entering the court premises when we came across dagga. We arrested the woman, who told us the parcel was destined for her boyfriend, who was appearing in court for murder and rape." Tshikalaha said the sentence came as good news to them. "We are excited about the outcome of the trial and we have hope that it will serve as a strong deterrent to would-be smugglers," she said.
