A local author whose work has won him international acclaim&nbsp;was shortlisted for a South African Literary Award. His second book, The Violent Gestures of Life, was nominated for the prestigious K Sello Duiker Memorial Literary Award 2016.&ldquo;I have received some literary awards before, but Sala is a significant award that every writer yearns to receive,&rdquo; Mukwevho said. &ldquo;Being nominated and shortlisted for Sala only affirms my hard work and grounding as a multifaceted writer, penning South African stories from rural Venda today,&rdquo; he said.The Violent Gestures of Life is loosely based on the author&rsquo;s personal experiences as a street-kid and a delinquent in the town of Louis Trichardt (Makhado). &ldquo;However, most parts of the novel take place in the reformatory school called Qalakabusha, simply meaning a place of new beginning,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We must not shy away from telling all these harsh&nbsp;but beautiful stories.&rdquo;The passionate author started writing while he was behind prison walls, and he is today one of the few good examples showing that youths do not belong in jail. &ldquo;On my release from prison in 2010, I had no job and I did not feel ashamed, as I sold &lsquo;cool times&rsquo; and sweets at the OK taxi rank in Makhado,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I happen to win this award, I am going to throw a mega party for my mothers and fathers who are hawkers at the taxi rank. I need to celebrate with them.&rdquo;In their media statement, SALA indicated that they were excited that South African literature continued to flourish, with many young writers coming onto the scene, sharing platforms with more established and experienced counterparts. &ldquo;We congratulate the 2016 nominees for their sterling work and keeping South Africa&rsquo;s literary heritage alive,&rdquo; Sala said.Mukwevho had been short-listed&nbsp;alongside Willem Anker and Panashe Chigumadzi.Mukwevho had just returned from Algeria, where he spent a week with Western Saharawi exiles in Dakhla Camp&nbsp;during the annual FiSahara International Film Festival. &ldquo;I read and recited my poetry to hundreds of exiles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I also did a bit of research to enable me to pen down a film script or at least two short stories based on the Saharauis&rsquo; tragedies or life experiences as exiles.&rdquo;The Sala award winners will be announced at a gala dinner on 7 November at UNISA, in Pretoria.
