A person&#39;s family background and where he or she hails from do not determine a person&#39;s success, but hard work and dedication break&nbsp;all barriers for one to succeed.Tondani Ethel Maimela is&nbsp;such a person. She is from a very rural village, but at the age of only 21, the lanky beauty from Ha-Muraga outside Thohoyandou has already garnered countless beauty titles and is destined for fame.It all started when she won the Miss Muraga title in 2011&nbsp;while still in Grade 11 at Thase School. In 2014, she was crowned first princess in the Face of Jo&#39;burg competition. Recently, she became a finalist for Miss Commonwealth SA 2016 and, judging by her confidence, she is destined to go far.Besides all the glamour and limelight, she has a soft spot for the less privileged and also encourages the youth&nbsp;to take&nbsp;education seriously. &quot;There is a stigma attached to beauty contests, where people think those involved cannot go far with their education. Through my non-profit organization I visit schools and inform learners about the importance of education and that education and beauty can work together.&quot;&nbsp;She added that she was also hosting beauty pageants at schools and, while visiting the schools, she and her group identified&nbsp;needy learners and provided them with sanitary pads and uniforms. They also assist in career guidance, social problems facing the youth as well as health issues.Maimela further indicated that they are currently going around schools in Jo&#39;burg and empowering learners.Those wishing to contact her or make some donations towards her organisation can phone her on 079 737 1185 or e-mail her at ethel&nbsp;tondi@gmail.com.
