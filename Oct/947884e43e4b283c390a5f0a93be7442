&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Poetry &amp; LiteratureThe 17 year-old Cindy Vhukhudo Netshisaulu of Ha-Rabali in the Makhado municipal area&nbsp;is fast becoming a role model to her peers in her community.The girl&#39;s writing skills have become her best comforter and friend in hard times and&nbsp;have lifted her to instant success. According to several observers, it is only a matter of time before she gets a break in the writing arena.The Grade 11 pupil at Patrick Ramaano Secondary School in the Nzhelele area says she feels as if she has company whenever she starts writing. A pen and a paper give her company when she is lonely, she added.Nestshisahulu&#39;s writing&nbsp;started in 2014 at the age of 15&nbsp;while she was suffering from depression. &quot;At that time, pen and paper were my worst enemies, but I&nbsp;drifted into writing. I felt like I was on my own with no one to comfort me in what I was going through. People were moving out of my life and my first writing was a novel about the challenges I was going through, and I also wrote a poem about nature.&rdquo;She added that she had produced a lot of material over the last two years, &ldquo;and all I need is someone who can assist me in seeing that my work is published. I have put&nbsp;a lot of energy into it and would like to see people all over the world read and appreciate my work,&quot; she said.Netshusahulu further said she felt blessed to have a mother who was&nbsp;everything to her. &ldquo;I was broken emotionally;&nbsp;I lost the real me, while my mom did all for us to dress, eat and laugh like others,&quot; she said.To the youth, Netshisahulu has a word of advice. &quot;Take your education as a priority and the rest will come as a bonus.&rdquo;
