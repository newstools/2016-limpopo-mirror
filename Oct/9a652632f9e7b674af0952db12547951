&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Art &amp; Sculpture | PhotographyA fascination with&nbsp;pictures in newspapers, magazines and photo albums had inspired a boy to consider starting a career in photography.Growing up in Nkovani in the Malamulele area, Thembani Mabunda knew all along that he was born to create a world of his own through cinematic and clear-cut photographs.&ldquo;My love for photography started at an early age when my late father, Samson Mabunda, bought me a Pentax 2000N 50mm in 1994,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I used that first camera to take photos of my fellow pupils in high school for&nbsp;a fee. Photography for me is a natural talent influenced by the love for colour and nature, which I love capturing.&rdquo;The founder and principal photographer at Purple Leaf Photography, Thembani obtained a national diploma in tourism management. He believes&nbsp;that tourism also supplements and fuels his passion in photography.&ldquo;I am also running Purple Leaf House photography studio at Malamulele Section B,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Photography is a passion which pays a lot. One can make a living out of it if one can take it as a career and acquire some skills at a higher-learning institution. The fact is that we have few professional photographers in South Africa.&rdquo;The former president of South Africa, Mr Thabo Mbeki, is his role model. &ldquo;He had an immerse contribution in the African Renaissance ideologies that opened opportunities for African unity and engagement for further African growth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His writings and speeches had encouraged many young men and women across the globe to be intellectuals that further encouraged African cooperation.&rdquo;So far, Thembani has&nbsp;extended his photographic services to local functions such as weddings, parties, funerals and high-profile events. People love his work. &ldquo;I am always humbled by the response&nbsp;I get from my clients,&rdquo; he said.
