Joe Maweja collected maximum points in their ABC Motsepe League match against A1 Terrors at the Tshifulanani Stadium last Saturday. Maweja could have sealed the game within the first 20 minutes, but their strikers, Mashudu Mukhari and Murendeni Makonde, seemed to have forgotten their scoring boots at home. Mukhari caused an upset 15 minutes into the game. This after he received a pre-cooked pass from Khumbudzo Muvhango within the box. Instead of trying his luck, Mukhari passed the ball to Murendeni Makonde, who was tightly marked. As if that was not good enough to annoy the team’s fans, Khumbudzo Muvhango squandered a golden scoring opportunity five minutes later. He dribbled past two of Terrors’ defenders and unleashed aimlessly from the edge of the penalty box. The ball went far wide. Maweja were the first to effect change to their starting lineup. They replaced Humbelani Nemasetoni with Fhulufhelo Sithodolo two minutes into the last half. The visitors from Modimolle responded by introducing Thabang Moreroa for Mpho Kekana in the 60th minute. Realizing that the strikers were showing no appetite for goals, the team’s captain, Dakalo Ratshitanga, abandoned his position and started to play as a full striker. Ratshitanga’s presence at the forefront forced the opponents to play defensive football. It took Maweja 74 minutes to score the goal that earned them three vital points. They were awarded a free kick in the 25-meter area after Aluwani Mbedzi was tackled from behind. Khumbudzo Muvhango beat the keeper with a volley from the free kick. Terrors went all out in the last 15 minutes of the game in their desperate search for the equalizing goal, but the defence of Maweja refused to see any stranger within their danger area.
