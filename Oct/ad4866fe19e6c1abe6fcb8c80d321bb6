Well-known musician and cleric&nbsp;Bishop Roxley Masevhe&nbsp;will soon stage a huge party to celebrate his life. This follows the honorary doctorate that the University of South Africa (Unisa) conferred on him last week.Speaking&nbsp;to Limpopo Mirror on Monday, only two days after receiving his honorary doctorate, Masevhe revealed that there will be big celebration at his church, Divine Grace Fire Temple in Itsani village, on 15 October. &quot;On this day I will be celebrating six years of my church&#39;s existence, 39 years of my career as a gospel artist, my 57th&nbsp;birthday and the honorary doctorate I received from Unisa.&rdquo; He received the honorary doctorate in recognition of his contribution to the community through music as a gospel artist.&quot;For me as a person who grew up playing music on a home-made guitar&nbsp;in the rural village&nbsp;of Thengwe, it was unimaginable to think that one day I would receive an honorary degree from an institution of Unisa&#39;s stature,&quot; said Masevhe. He added that the youth should follow&nbsp;their dreams with passion. &quot;If you are studying, study hard. I advise the&nbsp;youth to focus on&nbsp;succeeding at all cost. Don&#39;t lose your focus. Don&#39;t quit.&rdquo;Masevhe, who has recorded more than 300 songs on his 38 albums, is also a music producer, songwriter, community builder, human rights activists and comedian of note. His leadership roles, which started at a young age, saw him elected as board member of the South African Recording Rights Association in 1992; he founded the Vhembe District Music Forum, which fought for the rights of the artists, and now he is the chairperson of the Limpopo Arts and Culture Federation, an organisation that promotes local artists. During his career, he received several awards locally and won many musical competitions.According to him, he is busy writing two books and he will also launch his career as a comedian soon.
