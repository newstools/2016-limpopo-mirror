After a break of two weeks, it will be business as usual for the teams affiliated to the NFD this weekend. Six matches will be played at various places throughout the country tomorrow, while the remaining two will be played on Sunday. Black Leopards are gearing up for a tough game. They will host University of Pretoria at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow. Amatuks will be lucky if they manage to hold Lidoda Duvha to a draw. Leopards played to a 2-2 draw with Mthatha Bucks at the Mthatha Stadium two weeks ago. Leopards were leading 2-0 at one stage but they conceded two late goals to come back home with a point in hand. At the same time, Amatuks were donating league points to Jomo Cosmos, to whom they lost 0-1 at the Tuks Stadium in Pretoria. Leopards’ right back, Phathutshehdzo Nange, saw red in their game against Mthatha Bucks in Mthatha two weeks ago and is still suspended. His role is likely to be taken by Thivhavhudzi Ndou, who has been out of action for four weeks. Should he be given a chance, it is expected that Ndou will form a deadly combination with Lebohang Mabotja, Dunga Munganga and Andiswa Ndawonde at the far back. Witbank Spurs will meet Santos at the Puma Rugby Stadium in Emalahleni. The pace setters, Thanda Royal Zulu, will fly to to the mother city for their encounter with FC Cape Town. Magezi will travel to Durban, where they will lock horns with Real Kings at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium. Mbombela United will host Royal Eagles at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit. The Cape derby between Milano United and Stellenbosch FC will be staged at the Coetzenburg Stadium. Jomo Cosmos take on Amazulu at the Olën Park Stadium in Potchefstroom, while Cape Town All Stars will have a date with Mthatha Bucks at the Athlone Stadium.
