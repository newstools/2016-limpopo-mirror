&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MusicThe Nights of Bliss with Maduvha festival that took place at Christ Worship House in Shayandima last Saturday night was a huge success and a large crowd of fans attended the event.The festival was attended by people from various communities in Limpopo and was marketed as an event aimed at&nbsp;showcasing&nbsp;the cultural diversity of Vhembe. Big names and legends in music, such&nbsp;as Irene Mawela, Oliver Mutukuzi, Colbert Mukwevho, Tshepo Tshola and Maduvha Madima, left music lovers crying for more. The organiser, Maduvha Madima, stated that the vision of the festival was&nbsp;mainly to allow local vernacular artists a platform at a mainstream level.She added that it was at&nbsp;occasions such as the festival where the district also celebrated the uniqueness of its culture. &nbsp;&quot;The festival provided the province with an opportunity to unify its citizens and the neighbouring countries to celebrate the rich cultural music and promote tourism in the province,&quot; she added. &ldquo;Our main aim is was not to make profit, but to market our province and show our talent.&rdquo;She also explained that some local musicians were &ldquo;ending up in the street or being pirated,&rdquo; without getting the benefits that the artists were working for.The MEC for&nbsp;Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, said culture was one of the main human tools that should not be left behind during the process of transformation. &ldquo;We must be proud of who we are instead of being copycats of other peoples&rsquo; cultures. We must learn to love and appreciate our history, tradition and morality because these form the basis from which a strong nation develops. Our indigenous languages should also be preserved for the benefit of the young generation and the community at large,&rdquo; said Ramathuba.She also stated that it was important for artists to treat their careers like a business, adding that the government was determined to help artists overcome financial difficulties.&nbsp;
