Members of the Musina police and the police&rsquo;s public order policing unit were on the scene where a bus was torched Wednesday morning by protesting miners of De Beers&rsquo;s Venetia Mine.The police are also investigating a case of malicious damage to property after the bus, belonging to the VM Diamond Transport Company, was set alight. The buses are used to transport mine workers living in the Musina and Blouberg areas to the Venetia Mine situated 85km from Musina.A spokesperson for the mine, Ms Innocent Mabusela, said VM Diamond Transport had&nbsp;been prevented from operating by a relatively small group of protesters.The protesters, said Mabusela, were&nbsp;busy with an unlawful strike and consisted&nbsp;of a group of current and former employees alike and some community members, no larger than 50.&ldquo;Venetia Mine management has attempted to engage the group, who are demanding that the mine pay out funds from an independent employee share scheme, the Equal Allocation Trust (EAT), which is a part of Ponahalo Investments,&rdquo; said Mabusela.The demand is being made in spite of EAT unit holders&#39; being made aware of the financial position of the company.Venetia mine has, however, managed to continue with limited operations&nbsp;but still had to postpone their upcoming Community Engagement Fair that was planned for this week. The particular focus of interest of this fair would be detailed opportunities for supplier and enterprise development, procurement, employment and community development with the mine and the dozen contracting companies that would also have&nbsp;participated.&ldquo;The fair [would have] presented an opportunity for broad and detailed communication on a number of issues, including the EAT,&rdquo; said Mabusela.&nbsp;&ldquo;The company will continue to communicate directly with all employees about the situation, including our contractors, who are also affected by this current legally unprotected action,&rdquo; said the mine.The mine offered employees alternative transport arrangements under SAPS escort on Tuesday.
