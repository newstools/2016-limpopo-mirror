Matangari High Aims secured a place in the quarterfinal stage of the Benjies Soccer Challenge when they brutally walloped Mudaswali United Brothers 4-0 at the Khubvi grounds on Sunday. Brothers displayed entertaining football in the first 10 minutes of the game, but things turned against them when they started to use rough tackles. They played the better part of the game with 10 men. This after their midfielder, Maanda Raedani, was given his marching orders for tackling Wilson Musekwa from behind in the 28th minute. The incident forced United Brothers to abandon their positions and play defensive football. High Aims were leading 1-0 when the teams adjourned for half time. Their opening goal came in the 39th minute when Rendani Ntsieni blasted in a rocket from just outside the penalty box. As if they were leading, Brothers continued to play defensive football in the second half. That forced High Aims to invade their territory, forcing their defenders to perform overtime. The wheel of fortune turned against Brothers again in the 64th minute. Thizwivhoni Dau hooked in the ball, following a scramble within the box. Realizing that they had nothing to defend,  Brothers advanced out of their danger area and started to play attacking football. Rendani Ntsieni of High Aims was booked for dangerous play in the 69th minute. Brothers lost hope in the last 20 minutes of the game. High Aims increased the margin through Wilson Musekwa. He gave the ball a final touch after a scramble within the box. The last goal for High Aims was an honor to Ndivhudza Shandukani. He beat the keeper with a ground cutter.
