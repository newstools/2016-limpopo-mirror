What was once just a promise from the mayor&nbsp;is turning into a reality. Not long ago, the mayor of Makhado promised the Munyai family that they would receive a decent house within the next three months. Some might&nbsp;have doubted whether it would happen, but the construction of the four-room house is currently underway in Nzhelele.Mayor Shonisani Mildred Sinyosi, together with her team, embarked on a project to visit the site last Wednesday. They spent the whole day assisting the contractor.The mayor said that Makhado will never be the same again. &ldquo;I want to change Makhado Municipality to be a better place than it was yesterday by taking services to the poor,&rdquo; she said. She further added that the Munyayi family would now have a roof over their heads.Three days after she was sworn into office, she identified a destitute family who needed a proper&nbsp;house at Tshituni Tshafhasi in Nzhelele. She realised their plight and promised to build them a decent house.She said that the elections were over now and that it was time for her to deliver the promised services to the people. &ldquo;The department is working hard to provide houses to the people,&rdquo; she said. She further said that building a house for the needy family was part of her turn-around strategy aimed at delivering quality services to the people of Makhado.The old woman and her 46-year-old son, David, shared the same house.Granny Munyai said that she believed that Sinyosi was a good Samaritan sent to her by God. &ldquo;I am happy that the mayor visited me again. I am going to live in a decent house. I thought it was just a joke, but now it&rsquo;s a reality,&rdquo; she said. The granny said that she was extremely grateful. &ldquo;It is a great deal of kindness shown to me by the mayor,&rdquo; she said.
