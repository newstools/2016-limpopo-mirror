Music “Being blind has never been an obstacle to showing the talent that God has given me,” said famous local gospel singer Livhuwani Sikwati (43), who hails from Waterval. He said that his music helped people who are in the dark to see the light. “When you are encountering adversities in life, my music can soothe your heart,” he said. Sikwati usually performs in Louis Trichardt on Saturdays next to Express Store to promote his music. “I promote my music every weekend, so that I can reach out to many music lovers,” he said. He began his music career in the early 90s and it wasn’t easy to be where he is today, because of his disability. “I worked very hard to be a successful musician, despite my disability.” His two children help him to carry the music equipment on weekends. When he was growing up, he always had a love for gospel music. He was inspired by a famous gospel singer, Emmanuel Mamphogoro. “Mamphogoro's music motivated me to become a gospel singer. This music heals many people's hearts,” he said. So far he has released five albums. He used to record his music at his studio at home, but it is not well-equipped and he is looking for help. “I am looking for a Good Samaritan to supply me with music equipment and transport, so that I can perform everywhere. The equipment that I use is very old,” he said. He further said that life had never been easy for him and he thanked God for giving him the gift of music. “I am a producer, songwriter and a singer. I want to promote upcoming local artists,” he added. His music focuses on challenges that peoples encounter in life. He advises people who have disabilities not to limit themselves. “Disability should never stand in your way. Do what you love, despite any disability,” he said.
