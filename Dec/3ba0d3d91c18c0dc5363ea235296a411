Mavu Sport Development wrapped up their programme for the year by staging a tournament at the Khubvi Benjies ground last Saturday. The tournament was presided with a gala dinner which was held at the Khoroni Hotel on Friday evening.Speaking to the invited guests at the gala dinner, the founder member of sport development, Mr Kenneth &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; Neluvhalani, revealed that his organisation has achieved a lot since its inception five years ago.According to him they have managed to train 50 coaches who are currently coaching different sporting codes in 20 schools. He stated that, even though their focus area was Limpopo Province way back in 2011, they are now operating in five provinces, Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, North West and Free State. Mr Neluvhalani further stated that a number of local schools are benefiting through the exchange programme with their counterparts from the Netherland.He further revealed that his organisation has produced a number of sport achievers in the past five years. Some of their products include the well-known cyclist, Justice Makhale, Dumisani Chauke (television sports analyst) and Muzi Maluleke (body builder). Makhale represented the country four times at international cycling races while Maluleke is rated among the top ten body builders in the world.Mr Neluvhalani expressed his disappointment about the fact that Justice Makhale was not getting the recognition he deserves locally and nationally, despite all his achievements. Mr Neluvhalani handed over eight pairs of soccer boots and two mountain bikes to Mr Thendo Phophi and Justice Makhale respectively at the gala dinner. Mr Phophi is the organizer for the Gwamasenga U/15 and U/12 teams.The president of the SAFA Vhembe Regional Association, Mr George Kubayi, appealed to the board of directors for Mavu Sports Development to assist them in developing football at schools level saying it was an area they were failing to reach as a regional football association.
