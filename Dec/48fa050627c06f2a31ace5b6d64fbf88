The Limpopo derby between Magezi FC and Black Leopards at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Sunday ended in a goalless draw. The absence of Sphelele Ntshangase in the Leopards&rsquo; midfield was evident from the onset as it was difficult for Lidoda Duvha to penetrate the defence of Magezi.Thivhavhudzi Ndou, the Leopards&rsquo; centre back, was the first player to go into the referee&rsquo;s book. Ndou was lucky to escape with only a&nbsp;yellow card after tackling Temptation Chiwunga from behind in the 15th minute. Leopards had themselves to blame for not sealing the game in the first half. Instead of playing their normal carpet football, the Thohoyandou outfit ballooned from behind and made&nbsp;it difficult for the strikers to control the ball.Leopards&rsquo; keeper, Aubrey Mathibe, denied Magezi a sure goal when he palmed Silas Maziya&rsquo;s half volley away for a corner kick in the 39th minute. Realizing that their scoring chances were slim, Leopards introduced Ivan Mahangwahaya at the expense of Mziwokuthula Zimu three minute into the last half. The home side responded by introducing Tsegofatso Ramabu for Mosesenyane Maswanganyi moments thereafter.Lidoda Duvha started to dictate the terms after replacing Meshack Maphangule with Morgan Shivambu in the 70th minute. Magezi played the last 20 minutes of the game with their backs against the wall. At that stage, Leopards were firing on all cylinders.Leopards were awarded three corner kicks in quick succession, but they failed to convert any of them.&nbsp;
