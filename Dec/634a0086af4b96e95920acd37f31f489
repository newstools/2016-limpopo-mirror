&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MusicHow many residents in the Vhembe district have ever watched, Dr Malinga performing live on stage? If not, start to gear up for the First Western Music Festival on 26 December at the Ali &amp; Adolf The Island Resort in Muraleni.Community members around Sinthumule and Kutama will have the privilege to experience the talent of one of the giants of music performing at their doorstep.According to the organiser, Mr Austin Ramaru, several popular artists will perform this year. He said the festival is aimed at&nbsp;providing&nbsp;a development platform for the growing number of local artists seeking opportunities.&ldquo;We see the event as contributing to social cohesion and nation building, while entrenching our African identity through musical performances,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our main aim is not to make profit, but to market our province and show our talent.&rdquo; Ramaru said that the festival aims to expose the untapped talent so abundant in the communities served by the organisers.&ldquo;The festival will provide the province with an opportunity to unify its citizens and its neighbouring countries to celebrate the rich cultural heritage and to promote tourism in the province, elevating the level of growing excitement among young adults, emerging business individuals, students and tourist enthusiasts.&rdquo;He stated that the vision of the festival was&nbsp;mainly to allow local artists a platform at a mainstream level. &ldquo;Very little is going on with regard to the promotion of Venda artists in South Africa. Some artists have already released more than three albums, but have never performed for&nbsp;an audience bigger than 100 people.&rdquo;He indicated that there was a large number of talented artists in the district and it hurts to see them ending up in the street or their work being pirated.Some of the artists who will perform at&nbsp;the festival are Dr Malinga, DJ Lulo Cafe from Metro FM, Fizzy, Prifix, DJ Rabs Vhafuwi, Khakhathi &amp; Friends, Mlatirho, Irene Mawela, Bellafonte, P/Postman, Dafro, Humbulani Ramagwedzha, Thora-Thora, Makhadzi, Ceephonix, Bennerman and many more.Tickets are available at R120 per person and the gate tickets will be R150, but the price of VIP tickets is R650. The gates will open at 11:00 and security will be very strict.
