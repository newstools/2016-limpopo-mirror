The Mayor of Lim 345, Joyce Bila, has urged community members to inform their ward councillors whenever there is a crisis in their communities, before they run to seek help elsewhere.She was speaking last week Friday during her visit to a family of a slain 17-year-old who was found dead and naked on the 10th of December in the Nkuzana RDP houses area. The family had been struggling to cover the burial costs, as there is no one working.According to mayor Bila, the municipality is there to help whenever there are social problems and people should utilise it. &ldquo;People should stop running to radio stations and other places seeking for help whenever there is a crisis, but they should first inform their ward councillors and ward committee members, because as the municipality we are there to help with service delivery and the social needs of our people,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;As a municipality we have taken a decision to help the family with a tent, chairs and food that will be used during the funeral,&rdquo; she said.Elia Sithole (17) was found dead in the Njhakanjhaka area and it is believed that he was killed by local criminals who wanted his money and clothes. Joao Sithole (54), the father of the slain boy, applauded the mayor for the donations and indicated that she has helped him.&ldquo;I would like to thank the mayor for donating food, a tent and chairs as I didn&rsquo;t know where to start or what to do as I didn&rsquo;t have money to buy and hire those things. May the Lord bless her and protect her in all she does,&rdquo; said a teary father.
