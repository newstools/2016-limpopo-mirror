Speedsters, reckless and negligent drivers who will be driving on the N1 road will have to think twice after the launch of the new high-tech vehicles that will be used to clamp down on moving violations on the N1.The MEC for&nbsp;Transport and Community Safety, Ms Nandi Ndalane, issued a stern warning to motorists travelling along the N1 road in Limpopo last week&nbsp;during the launch of the new vehicles.&quot;The Department of Transport said that they cannot deploy the Traffic Police at every kilometer on the N1 for speed and traffic violations. Some motorists are taking advantage of this unfortunate situation. They should beware now,&quot; she said.She added that the Department had&nbsp;moved with speed in procuring vehicles with the help of the Road Traffic Management Corporation, which will be fitted with new technology to monitor for moving violations, including and not limited to, excessive speeding, unsafe overtaking and reckless and negligent driving, among&nbsp;others.She also said that the unmarked vehicles would patrol the entire stretch of the N1 in the Limpopo Province. She warned that the department would adopt zero tolerance for traffic offenders on the N1. &quot;Many accidents which are caused by speed are unacceptably high,&quot; she said.She further said that as the Department they could&nbsp;not fold their arms when innocent lives were being taken on their roads by irresponsible motorists.&nbsp; &quot;Harsh actions will be taken against those found to be violating the rules of the road,&quot; she said.&nbsp;
