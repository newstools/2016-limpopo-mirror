The case of an elderly taxi owner, Mrs Mushathama Sarah Makaukau, may soon receive the necessary attention and consideration from the Department of Transport. This comes after the national office of the Department of Transport had confirmed receipt of a complaint from Mrs Makaukau.The elderly lady had requested both the district and provincial offices of the Department of Transport to intervene in the dispute between her and the Zoutpansberg Taxi Association (ZTA).The problem started when the ZTA allegedly converted Makaukau&#39;s permit from the Hlanganani Taxi Association to their taxi association without her understanding and explicit instructions. The 87-year-old Makaukau also insists that the ZTA must refund&nbsp;her, which amounts to around R20 000. She alleges that she continued to pay &ldquo;unnecessary monthly fees&rdquo; to the association.Makaukau feels that the ZTA had been abusing her, since they had converted her permit to their association. &ldquo;When I speak with them, they harass me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just wanted to sit down with them and solve the problem, but they won&rsquo;t give me that chance. This is the reason why I decided to contact the minister of transport, Ms Dipuo Peters. I hope her office will assist.&rdquo;However, the ZTA&rsquo;s chairperson, Mr Thiathu Maimela, has&nbsp;since denied Makaukau&rsquo;s claims of abuse and said that the money she was referring to was for affiliation purposes.The official within the minister&rsquo;s office, Ms Lavhelesani Mulangaphuma, confirmed receipt of Makaukau&rsquo;s letter of grievance and said that they were busy processing the complaint. &ldquo;Her complain will receive immediate attention once we have processed it,&rdquo; she said.
