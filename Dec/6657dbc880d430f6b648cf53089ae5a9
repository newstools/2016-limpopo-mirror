The management of Sedzazwau Lodge and Conference Centre, one of the most frequented resorts at Tswinga outside Thohoyandou, came out spitting fire last weekend.This follows the uprooting and vandalization of their signboards from the main Punda Maria road to the entrance of the resort.&nbsp;Four of their signboards were brought down in an act that has been construed as jealousy of&nbsp;the thriving business that has become the centre of a lot of&nbsp;activities, including weddings, company year-end parties, and church and school functions among others.Mr Masala Ratshalingwa, who is a member of staff at the resort, said the boards were damaged on Thursday and they were notified by revellers who told them about the missing boards. &quot;We are still surprised and shocked as to how people could stoop so low and remove informative sign boards, thereby trying to destroy our business. This business is well marketed as we buy adverts on radio and in newspapers. There is no way they will stop people from frequenting this area.&rdquo;He added that they had&nbsp;the best facilities and people did&nbsp;not complain about their service. &ldquo;Our services will speak for themselves and things will speak for themselves and we are not deterred at all. We will continue giving our clients the best.&rdquo;He said that the culprits should desist from what they were doing, &ldquo;otherwise they will end up in jail. We have opened a case against the perpetrators.&quot;Thohoyandou police spokesperson Const Avhafarei Tshiovhe confirmed that the incident was reported. &quot;We have opened a malicious-damage-to-property case and so far no one has been arrested in connection with the incident. Our investigations continue,&quot; she said.
