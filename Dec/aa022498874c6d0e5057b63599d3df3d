Vaseline Petroleum Jelly presented the Mpheni Clinic with&nbsp;a wheelchair, crutches&nbsp;and medical kit during a ceremony at the clinic last Tuesday.The operational manager in the Mpheni Clinic, Ms Emily Mulondo, said that they were surprised by the donation that makes the work of nurses easier when admitting disabled and paralyzed patients. &ldquo;Our nurses used to suffer by lifting disabled and paralyzed patients in their arms. We also appreciate the medical kit, which also includes a blood pressure metre,&rdquo; said Mulondo.Ms Tryphosa Malahlela, marketing promoter of the Magents Marketing Company, which was contracted by Vaseline Petroleum Jelly to do marketing for them, said Vaseline understood that clinics sometimes struggled to provide top-notch care&nbsp;to patients&nbsp;because they had&nbsp;shortages of medical supplies. &ldquo;We are here to assist one of your clinics and we hope the donation of the wheelchair, crutches and medical kit will help the nurses at Mpheni to give better service to the community,&rdquo; said Malahlela.The assistant manager clinical supervisor to the clinics around Waterval/Nthabalala, Mr Thomas Khoza, said they were delighted to find out that Vaseline Petroleum Jelly had decided to help one of the local clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
