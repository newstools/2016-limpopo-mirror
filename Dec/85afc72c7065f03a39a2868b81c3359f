Black Leopards have reason to believe that they will collect the maximum league points against Magezi FC, with whom they will rub shoulders in their NFD League match at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon.The game is expected to keep the fans at the edge of their seats for two reasons. In the first instance Magezi will be fighting for survival as they are languishing at the bottom of the log with nine points accumulated from 13 matches. Magezi won only one match under the guidance of their newly appointed coach, Mr Shepherd Murape, who joined the NFD rookies early last month. The only match they won under Murape&rsquo;s mentorship was a 3-2 victory over Amazulu at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium two weeks ago.On the other hand, Black Leopards must win the match at all costs in order to remain in the league title race. The Thohoyandou outfit are lying in the seventh&nbsp;spot with 17 points. Black Leopards will be without their diminutive midfielder, Khayelihle Shozi, who saw red in their game against Thanda Royal Zulu at the Thohoyandou Stadium last Saturday. Leopards&rsquo; strikers, Mwape Musonda, Leonard Ntshangase and Ivan Mahangwahaya, are poised to give the defenders of Magezi no time to breathe throughout the game.Thanda Royal Zulu will host Cape Town All Stars at the Umhlatuze Sports Complex in Richards Bay and the University of Pretoria will play against Milano United at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town.Five matches&nbsp;will be played tomorrow (Saturday). The fixtures are Santos vs Amazulu, Royal Eagles vs Jomo Cosmos,&nbsp;Mbombela United vs Witbank Spurs, Mthatha Bucks vs FC Cape Town and Real Kings vs Stellenbosch FC.
