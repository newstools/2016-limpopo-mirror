The Department of Correctional Services recently brought smiles to the faces of the children at the Takalani Children&#39;s Home at Siloam in the Nzhelele area.The Thohoyandou Area Management&#39;s community corrections decided to raise funds among colleagues and buy Christmas gifts for the little ones at the children&#39;s home. &ldquo;We wanted to give our children an early Christmas gift, so that they could have a feeling that they were still members of the larger community here in the district,&rdquo; said Mr Farisani Mulaudzi, head of community corrections.He indicated that Christmas meant that people should celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and his good deeds to humanity. &ldquo;We know that there are individuals who still get overexcited&nbsp;on this day and hurt one another or just harm others for no apparent reason. They just do that because they are drunk.&rdquo;He called upon parents to start loving their children and taking good care of them. &ldquo;No sane parent could reject her or his children,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;African values say we should stick together in love, unity and peace.&rdquo;He concluded by urging all community members, businesspeople and other stakeholders to get involved in taking care of the children who stayed or lived in children&#39;s homes.Takalani Children&#39;s Home is&nbsp;home to abused and&nbsp;abandoned&nbsp;children from vulnerable backgrounds,and neglected and unoccupied minors.A 15-year-old representative of the Takalani Children&#39;s Home, Suzan Maluleke, thanked the department for being so considerate and thinking about them. &ldquo;We heartily thank you for the visit and gifts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The love you have shown us today could not be seen only in the gifts but by your presence here at our place. Please do come to see us again, and spend a day with us like you did today.&rdquo;
