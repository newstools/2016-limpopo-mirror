Traditional leaders from around the province highlighted the problem of illegal dumping of especially disposable nappies in villages, during a recent two-day Natural Resources Management Capacity Building&nbsp;Programme that was held at the Matsila Guest&nbsp;House.Former Premier of KwaZuluNatal&nbsp;Dr Zweli Mkhize&nbsp;urged traditional&nbsp;healers not to chop down&nbsp;indigenous trees for herbs. He also encouraged poor communities to start community&nbsp;bakeries, brick making and other&nbsp;projects in order to create jobs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Traditional leaders should work hand in hand with ward&nbsp;councillors to ensure better&nbsp;service delivery and people&nbsp;should stop vandalising&nbsp;properties. The burning down&nbsp;of more than 20 schools in the&nbsp;Vuwani area was a shining&nbsp;example of what needs to be&nbsp;ended in terms of vandalism. As leaders of the communities,&nbsp;traditional leaders should unite&nbsp;the people and stop&nbsp;tribalism, so we all work towards&nbsp;the development and bettering&nbsp;of our society,&rdquo; Mkhize said.The director of the Vuvha-based Dzomo la&nbsp;Mupo Project, Mphatheleni Makaulule, said&nbsp;traditional leaders should stop&nbsp;the deforestation that is rife in&nbsp;villages. This deforestation, she explained, contributes to&nbsp;the communities&#39; being left without&nbsp;a source of water because&nbsp;springs and wells dry up as a result of deforestation. &ldquo;We have built a nursery of&nbsp;indigenous trees and we want&nbsp;to plant them on the banks of&nbsp;the rivers, schools, traditional&nbsp;leaders&rsquo; offices, and in&nbsp;townships, &rdquo;&nbsp;Makalule&nbsp;said.Chief Livhuwani Matsila said&nbsp;most of the rivers were polluted&nbsp;by disposable nappies which&nbsp;then flowed down the rivers to dams, causing a health risk to all the&nbsp;communities. The contamination of drinking water in the dams&nbsp;may lead to a cholera outbreak, which is of grave concern to&nbsp;the traditional leaders, while&nbsp;mosquitoes coming from the&nbsp;waste may cause illness such as&nbsp;malaria.He said it was&nbsp;the&nbsp;responsibility of traditional leaders and the community&nbsp;to embark on an Adopt a&nbsp;River Programme, a clean-up&nbsp;campaign where all dumped&nbsp;nappies and waste should be&nbsp;removed from rivers and&nbsp;dams.The workshop&nbsp;is a flagship&nbsp;project supported by&nbsp;the Department of Environmental Affairs, with a vision to inculcating&nbsp;a culture of responsibility and accountability for&nbsp;the management of&nbsp;natural resources among traditional leaders as&nbsp;primary and chief&nbsp;land users in rural&nbsp;areas. It is a three-year programme and the implementing agent appointed by the&nbsp;Department of Environmental Affairs&nbsp;is Livhuwani Matsila and Associates.
