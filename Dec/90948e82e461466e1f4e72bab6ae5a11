About 70 disadvantaged families in the Muledane area received an early Christmas on Sunday, when a well-known Vhembe traditional leader gave them Christmas hampers.Chief Jerry Tshikororo handed over groceries and school uniforms to the families during an event held at the royal palace at Muledane.The initiative was started a few years ago to assist pupils from disadvantaged families with uniforms, but later included groceries that would ensure a good Christmas for the families.Handing over the hampers, Tshikororo said that they were continuing where they had left off last year. &quot;Giving has become part of our lives. We started this a few years ago, inspired by the late Nelson Mandela, who taught us to care for others.&rdquo;He added that many people would be spending a lot of money on &ldquo;useless things, forgetting that the school year would be starting soon. We felt that we should give our children a gift of life, which is education.&rdquo;They also provided groceries to needy families to put smiles on their faces during Christmas. &ldquo;This is the time of giving and sharing the little we have, and we hope this would change the conditions of the beneficiaries, at least during this period,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
