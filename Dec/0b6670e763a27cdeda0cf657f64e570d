Black Leopards must win their NFD First Division match against Royal Eagles at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (Saturday) to remain in the league title race.The match is expected to attract a huge number of spectators, for several reasons. In the first instance Royal Eagles will refuse to donate points to Leopards, as doing so will narrow their chances of taking the league title to Pietermaritzburg at the end of the season. Eagles are currently lying in the second position on the log. The Eagles&rsquo; coaches, Mr Kostadin Papic, and his assistant, Mr Joel &ldquo;The Prophet&rdquo; Masutha, also have a point to prove. The Serbian mentor and his assistant were employees of Black Leopards before moving to the Kwazulu Natal side early this season.Leopards&rsquo; defenders, Jean Munganga, Lebohang Mabotja and Marks Munyai, must keep a close eye on the Eagles&rsquo; fast forwards, Raymond Monama and Sedwyn George. George scored a brace when Royal Eagles beat Jomo Cosmos 2-1 at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg last Saturday.Black Leopards will be without their diminutive striker, Khayelihle Shozi, tomorrow. Shozi saw red in their game against Thanda Royal Zulu at the Thohoyandou Stadium two weeks ago.In other NFD matches this weekend, the University of Pretoria will host Mthatha Bucks at the Tuks Stadium in Pretoria. Real Kings will face Witbank Spurs at the Puma Rugby Stadium in Emalahleni and Mbombela United will fly to Cape Town for their match against FC Cape Town.The match of the week will be between Stellenbosch FC and Thanda Royal Zulu at the Coetzenburg Stadium. Thanda are leading the pack, while Stellenbosch are close in the third position. Jomo Cosmos will host Santos at the Ol&euml;n Park Stadium in Potchefstroom and Amazulu and Milano United will fight for points at the Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban. &nbsp;
