Thousands of people are expected to turn up at the ringside&nbsp;during the next rounds of the traditional boxing (Musangwe) tournaments. The tournaments started two weeks ago in Tshifudi and will continue until January next year.Steven Nditwani showed his supporters that he was not roaring for nothing, when he convincingly battled to a draw with Khodani &ldquo;Cinah&rdquo; Nephalama. In another match, Killer Makhado lost to Avhurengwi Lala. In the fight between Checkers and Hali Hali, Khetho Checkers was declared the winner. The most entertaining fight was between Mpgungwa and Edwin &ldquo;MTG&rdquo; Chauke. The fight was declared a draw.According to the president of Musangwe, Tshilidzi &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; Ndevana, participants are allowed to head-butt or kick opponents with a knee, beat them to a pulp or even put a curse on them. &ldquo;If you are weak, you will eventually regain consciousness in the back of an ambulance,&rdquo; he said.Ndevana said that no person suffering from HIV would be allowed to fight. The fear of spreading the disease recently prompted the organisers of the tournament to stop fights at the sight of serious open wounds.Volunteers are randomly chosen from two teams to fight until one of them is either knocked out or surrenders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear anybody. I believe in fighting with an opponent or enemy until he conquers me or I conquer him,&rdquo; said Steve Ndiitwani.He said it was the sport that he enjoyed most. &ldquo;Some say it is a primitive game, but I don&rsquo;t agree, because it is like other games. It is meant to promote friendship, because we bear no grudges after the fight, even if one is defeated. This is the game of our forefathers and we will never stop following in their footsteps.&rdquo;
