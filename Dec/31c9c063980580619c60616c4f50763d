Clemour Ngobeni, popular finalist of&nbsp;The Voice South Africa show, will host a very special Red Carpet Music Concert on Christmas Eve in Waterval. His local performance is also a way in which he wants to&nbsp;thank&nbsp;his fans for their support over the past year.At the beginning of the year, very few people knew about the singing talents of this young man from Limpopo. He entered for The Voice SA and the rest is, as they say, history. During his time at the show he performed alongside internationally acclaimed musicians such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Lira, Kahn Morbee from the Parlotones and he also worked with the legendary Vicky Sampson.Clemour&rsquo;s last &ldquo;big achievement&rdquo; was when he was invited to sing the national anthem when the Springbok rugby team took on the Wallabies on 1 October. He mesmerized the almost 50 000 spectators who attended the match at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria.On Christmas Eve (24 December) Clemour Music will be hosting a Red Carpet Music Concert called The Night Before Christmas with Clemour. The event will be held at the Fountains of Life church at Ha-Chabani. The venue can accommodate 1100 people. A number of guest&nbsp;artists from Johannesburg, Pretoria, Limpopo and Cape Town will also join Clemour on stage.&ldquo;We are bringing the beauty of a super, explosive music concert to the village, to inspire, motivate, encourage, and entertain and to influence the new generation that anything is possible, regardless of your background,&rdquo; Clemour said in a statement last week.
