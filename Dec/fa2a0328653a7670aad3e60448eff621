The organisers had noted that most young girls loved pageants but had to travel to big cities for exposure. Some of the local girls, said organisers, were not confident enough to exude their beauty.&ldquo;A lot of young girls really love pageants, but can&rsquo;t enter because they are not comfortable showing off their skin, or not feeling safe because of the people who will be drinking alcohol and doing all sorts of bad things in the vicinity,&rdquo; said the organiser, Selokela Lekoloana.He stated that the pageant was also a platform for winning souls to the Kingdom of God in an entertainment way. &ldquo;The Bible says we must go and preach the Gospel of God, win souls in all different spheres of the world,&rdquo; he said. There are a lot of spheres such as education, politics and economics. But we chose to bring Jesus Christ into the world of pageant!&rdquo;An 18-year-old Ndivho Makhwanya from Louis Trichardt was crowned Miss Beauty in Christ queen, while Caroline Mashala (21) was named 1st princess, and Selaelo Mahasha (16) second princess.The official sponsors of the pageant were COLANA, Eve-Rob Photography &amp; Events, Vhembe Academy of Arts and Music, Salvation for Christ International Ministries and Lukies Travel and Conferences.
