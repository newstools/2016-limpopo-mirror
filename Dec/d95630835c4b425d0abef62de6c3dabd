The Greater Calvary Church at Tshirolwe in Nzhelele, which is led by Apostle Khathutshelo Ramovha, is becoming popular with people from all corners of Vhembe district as a large number are&nbsp;flocking into the church for a touch of a miracle.Ramovha is the very man who survived the collapse of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Nigeria nearly two years ago and emerged after the collapse with a resounding testimony.Today, Ramovha, who is also the author of a Christian book, He Is More Than Just a God, said that the church was growing into a bigger denomination, not because of his power or strength. &ldquo;I preach the Word of God and all people who come here get back to their houses as healed individuals who posses far greater testimonies about the change in their lives,&rdquo; he said.Some church members said that they were healed of HIV and Aids after Ramovha and his &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; (junior pastors) had laid hands on them in prayer. &ldquo;When I first came here I was skinny; one could&nbsp;only see bones when one looked at me,&rdquo; said a woman in the presence of church members. &ldquo;Today I am a healthy person because of the God of Greater Calvary Church. People can say bad things about my pastor, but those bad words will not make me quit coming to Greater Calvary Church, because I got life in this church.&rdquo;Ramovha said that the world had arrived at a point where people needed to hear pastors preach messages of hope and love and not condemnation. &ldquo;People are suffering and their only hope can be found in Jesus,&rdquo; Ramovha said. &ldquo;Today, when I see all these large numbers of people flocking into the church which I lead, I smile and get to understand the reason why God had spared my life from death by rescuing me from the SCOAN&#39;s collapse.&rdquo;Our reporter attended one service at The Greater Calvary Church, where the apostle was praying for people and announcing that God had given him powers to heal all kinds of sicknesses, from asthma, cancer, leprosy, and eye problems to kidney failure.&nbsp;Most people who attended the service seemed happy and even announced that every one of them had a testimony to tell about the kind of help they had received from the church.&ldquo;I know there may be many critics who will just speak ill about the work which the Lord is doing through me,&rdquo; Ramovha said. &ldquo;Don&#39;t just criticise; come to the church and see if God&#39;s spirit will not touch you. You too, who are critics, will testify good things about this great ministry only if you come to church. So, don&#39;t criticise from just seeing stories in the media or hearing about us from people in the streets.&rdquo;
