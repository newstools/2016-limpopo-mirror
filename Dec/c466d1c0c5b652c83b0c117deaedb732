&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Poetry / LiteratureThe first ever poetry session in the Vhembe district had attracted poets and poetry lovers from all corners of the district. At least three established poets from Gauteng joined the sessions at the Thulamela Main Library and participated in a feast of poetry.The quality performances and quality material proved that the district had instantly become a home of the spoken word.A young poet, Arehone Matambele, recited a sterling poem entitled A Pain for a Gain, to critical acclaim and acceptance by audience. &ldquo;It was a great honour to procure a platform from the Nwala Writers Club as we had to converse through poetry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Poetry is the best method I use to pour out what is inside me. And through this art of poetry, I desire to succour, apprise and spread the gospel.&rdquo;Another poet, Aniki Nefale recited a poem challenging the mantra &ldquo;united we stand, divided we fall&rdquo;. Her poem, Untitled, tackled issues of hatred and the ugliness which continues to be the order of the day.Three poets, Gin Daily, Ezra Selulu and Anga Mamfanya, travelled all the way from Gauteng, to come and share the stage with Vhembe poets.The spokesperson for the Nwala Writers Club and publisher at Vhakololo Press, Tshifhiwa Given Mukwevho, said that youths possessed far much greater talent and performance skills than what he had thought of them when he first walked into the hall.&ldquo;Not that I underestimate the youths&rsquo; talent and capabilities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes you just look at all the quiet faces and you think that all about them ends in the quietness of their faces. Their voices, as poets, are amazing.&rdquo;Mukwevho said that, having travelled the world and performed on international stages, he could surely confess that the poets here in Vhembe district were as talented and skilful as poets from other parts of the world.&ldquo;All they need is continued support and mentorship from supportive organisations such as Nwala Writers Club, to ensure that their poems are developed into publishable material,&rdquo; he said.
