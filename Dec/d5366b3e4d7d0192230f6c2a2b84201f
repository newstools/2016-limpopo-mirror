Thanks to a generous donation, 51 families from around the Vhembe District received an early Christmas gift.The gifts were food parcels that were stocked with all the basic supplies that would not only see the families through Christmas, but well after the festive season as well.The lavish gifts were part of the birthday celebrations of Pastor Murunwa Tshigomana of the Back to Creator Worship Centre. Her donations are part of a long-standing tradition in which she rather gives away presents to the needy instead of waiting to receive presents herself.As her years have progressed, so did the number of presents Tshigomana donates. During her 50th birthday celebrations an equivalent number of grocery parcels were handed out. Hence the reason 51 parcels were donated this year.This year the parcels were handed out during a special service held at the Mass College and North Tech premises at Muledane, outside Thohoyandou on Saturday (3 December). It was attended by servants of God from different churches like Bishop Ndadza and Pastor Yvonne Kruger of End Time Ministry in Louis Trichardt, local ward councillor, Cllr Tshitereke Nelushi and the local traditional leadership.The groceries left a bright and lasting impression on the beneficiaries. &ldquo;We are very happy as a family, no one is working in this family and the lovely gesture from Pastor Tshigomana will help us face Christmas with bright faces,&rdquo; said one of beneficiaries on behalf of her family.Tshigomana said she was following the teachings of the Bible, which says those who are blessed should serve as vehicles to bless the less privileged. &ldquo;We are here not only to minister to the spirit, but also to the physical being which needs food and clothing,&rdquo; said Tshigomana.
