Benny&rsquo;s Sports Academy from Tshiozwi received an award in the Best Developing School category during the annual South African Sports Awards held in Bloemfontein on Sunday.Benny&rsquo;s made headlines in national and local media when they represented South Africa in the Danone Nations World&nbsp;Cup held in France two months ago. Benny&rsquo;s received R145&nbsp;000 and a trophy for winning the category.The awards&rsquo; aim was to recognise and honour individuals and teams who have excelled both on and off the field. Although the Limpopo Department of Sports, Arts and Culture didn&rsquo;t present&nbsp;Benny&rsquo;s with any recognition during their provincial awards ceremony, the school has been doing well throughout the year.During the event on Sunday, Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said the developing school team of the year award should go to a school that came from the rural or historically disadvantaged area, produced extraordinary consistency as a team, managed to conquer against all odds with limited resources and demonstrated essential values of teamwork, resilience, courage and excellence.The school&rsquo;s managing director, Mr Benny Mufamadi, said the pupils and the entire staff were&nbsp;over the moon with the award. He said Limpopo was &ldquo;the province of stars&rdquo; and that they were expecting more next year. &ldquo;The sky is the limit,&rdquo; said Mufamadi.Premier Stanley Mathabatha also congratulated&nbsp;Benny&rsquo;s with their achievement. &ldquo;It means that we are doing something good in Limpopo. Several national clubs have one or two boys from Limpopo and they are doing extremely well. Those that come to mind include Hlompho Kekana and Tiyani Mabunda of Mamelodi Sundowns, Mulomowandau Mathoho of Kaizer Chiefs and many others who hail from towns and villages in our province,&rdquo; Mathabatha said.
