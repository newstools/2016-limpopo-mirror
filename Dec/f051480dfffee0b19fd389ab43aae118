A cloud of sadness still hangs over the Nhlavulani vilage after a 17-year-old girl, Suprise Nkuna, was allegedly stabbed and killed last Friday.The deceased was a Grade 11 pupil at Mukula Secondary School.&nbsp; Her mother, Ms Elizabeth Mabasa, said that the family were battling to cope with the loss. &ldquo;It is really painful. She was still young and did not deserve to die like that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to see justice done. Nkuna was very focused on education, and I expected her to complete her studies, so that she could help the family.&quot;The girl was stabbed several times when a suspect broke a window and entered the house where she was staying with her younger sister and brother.The principal of Mukula High, Mr Edward Kharidzha, said she was a bright pupil who always worked hard at school. &ldquo;This came as a shock to us. Nkuna never quarrelled with anyone and she easily associated herself with people.&rdquo;The spokesperson for the police, Lt Col Ngotshe Ngoepe, said that the incident occurred at about&nbsp;midnight.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were alerted by members of the community about the incident, and when we arrived at the scene, Nkuna was lying dead on the ground,&rdquo; he said.He added that the police had subsequently opened a case of murder. &ldquo;Our investigations are still continuing. We also managed to arrest a suspect the next day.&rdquo;The suspect, Tshedza Tshikovhi (22), appeared briefly in the Giyani Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Monday&nbsp;and the case was postponed to 9 December for further investigations. Nkuna will be laid to rest at Nhlavulani cemetery tomorrow (Saturday).
